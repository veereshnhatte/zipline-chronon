    External sources are online only data sources. During fetching, using

    java client library that can be used to fetch a batch of External source
    requests efficiently.

    Internally Chronon will batch these requests to the service and parallelize
    fetching from different services, while de-duplicating given a batch of
    join requests.

    The implementation of how to fetch is an `ExternalSourceHandler` in

    Bootstrap is the concept of using pre-computed feature values and skipping backfill computation during the
    training data generation phase. Bootstrap can be used for many purposes:
    - Generating ongoing feature values from logs
    - Backfilling feature values for external features (in which case Chronon is unable to run backfill)
    - Initializing a new Join by migrating old data from an older Join and reusing data

    One can bootstrap against any of these:

    - join part fields:
        Bootstrap can happen at individual field level within a join part.
        If all fields within a group by are bootstrapped, then we skip computation for group by. Otherwise, the whole
        thing will be re-run but only the values for the non-bootstrapped fields will be retained in the final table.
    - external part fields:
        Bootstrap can happen at individual field level within an external part.
        Since there is no backfill logic in chronon for external part, all non-bootstrapped fields in external parts
        are left as NULLs.
    - derivation fields:
        Derived fields can also be bootstrapped. Since derived fields depend on "base" fields (either join part or
        external part), chronon will try to trigger the least amount of computation possible. For example,
        if there is a join part where all derived fields that depend on the join part have been bootstrapped,
        then we skip the computation for this join part.
    - keys:
        Keys of both join parts and external parts can be bootstrapped. During offline table generation, we will first
        try to utilize key's data from left table; if it's not there, then we utilize bootstrap.
        For contextual features, we also support propagating the key bootstrap to the values.
